When to impute with mean and median ? 
impute with mean when data is normally distirbuted 
impute with median when data is rightly or leftly skewed


What is difference between R squared and Adjusted R squared ? 
Rsquared will add if we keep on increasing variables However Adjusted R squared will penalise
Write the formula for them ? 

How do you check correlation between various independet varaibles ? 
Answer - VIF

What is the Range of R squared ? 
0 to 1 
What is Range of Correlation ? 
Answer -1 to 1 


What is the difference between covariance and correlation ? 
correlation - simple if one variable is highly correlated with another variable that means what one variable
 is explaining can be explained by other variables as well hence instead of two variables we will go with one varaibles
covariance - if one varaible is changed how much other variable is changed 

What is MAE , MAPE, CV score 
MAE = 1/total points sum of all points(Actual - Predicted)

MAPE = (Sum of all data points (Actual - Predicted)/Actual)/number of data points * 100 

MAPE = over percentage
MAE = without peercentage

Precision = proportion of True positive / All positive predictions instance
Recall = proportion of True Positives / All Actual Positive Instance 

MAE = summation (for all data points abs(actual - predicted) )/(all data points )
L1 loss = summation (for all data points abs(actual - predicted) )
L2 loss =  summation (for all data points (sqaureroot(actual - pred)^2) )


if there are outliers with the data 
 - i will use L1 loss 
 
  







What is F1 Score ?  2PR/P + R - because of class imbalence 
Why harmonic mean is used not arithmetic means ? 
F1 Score gives more weight to lower values 


Just writting the formula of R squared and Adj R squared
R2 = 1 - (RSS/ TSS) 
RSS - Residual sum of squared = for all datapoints (actual - predicted )^2
TSS - Total Sum of squared = for all data points (Actual - Avg of Actual)^2

Adjusted R squared = 1 - (((1- R2)(n -1))/(n - k-1))
n - number of observations
k = number of independent variables 

Tweedie Loss 
= -1/N (Actual * Predicted^(1-P)/1-P  + Predicted^(2-P)/2-P   )
